- **WARNING** : this library only merge the files, apply no compression on them !!!! The size will stay the same.
- **Modifications** :  
  - adding a html "test" page.
  - in "zip.js"  
    - adding a "file-counter"  
      - line "this.filesCount = 0;" in constructor  
      - lines "this.filesCount++;" in fecth2zip, str2zip and files2zip methods  
      - added "filesCounted..." function (return this.filesCount)  
      - WHY ???  
        - "fecth2zip" use asynchronous fetch to get the files !  
        - SO : need to wait for all files to be loaded, ELSE making the zip will create a fake zip.  
        - it's very important to control the "filesCount" to verify that all files are loaded, before making the zip
